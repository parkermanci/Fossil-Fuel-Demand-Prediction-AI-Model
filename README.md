# Fossil-Fuel-Demand-Prediction-AI-Model

Using a particular month and hour as the input, the first predicts watts of solar electricity produced per hour, the second predicts watts of wind electricity produced per hour, and the third predicts the hourly electricity demand in watts for PA (the second, third, and fourth blocks of code). From there, the outputs of model 1 and model 2 are subtracted from the output of model 3. The resulting number is an estimate of the watts of fossil fuels needed to meet the electricity demand per hour.
